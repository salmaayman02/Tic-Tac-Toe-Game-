# Tic Tac Toe Game with AI

This repository contains a graphical Tic Tac Toe game with the following features:
- **Two-Player Mode**
- **AI Opponent**: Implemented using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms.
- **Random Player**: A basic random-move AI implementation.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using Python's `tkinter`.

## Features
1. **Minimax Algorithm**: Optimal decision-making AI for Tic Tac Toe.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhanced Minimax algorithm for better performance.
3. **Random AI**: A simple AI making random moves (implemented in `random.py`).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai
   ```

2. Run any of the Python files to play:
   - `MinMax.py`: Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI.
   - `AlphaBeta.py`: Tic Tac Toe with Alpha-Beta Pruning AI.
   - `random.py`: Tic Tac Toe with Random AI.

   Example:
   ```bash
   python MinMax.py
   ```

## How to Play
- **Two-player mode**: Take turns to place X and O on the grid.
- **AI mode**: Play against the computer.

## Future Improvements
- Add more difficulty levels for the AI.
- Implement a scoring system.
